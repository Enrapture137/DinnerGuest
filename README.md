Learning how to use lists and random number/choices in python. 
-Program has a set guest list to start, then generates a random number to see how many guests from the OG list can't attend. 
-It then removes those guests from the list before asking you who you want to invite. 
-It uses an infinite loop to take your input (accounting for wrong input for questions) and adds your names to the list.
-It then counts the length of the list and prints your total as well as your guest list.
